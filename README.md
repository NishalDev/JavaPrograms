# Java Programs Repository

This repository contains various Java programs organized into different folders. Each program addresses a unique problem and is implemented using core Java concepts. Below is a brief description of each program:

## Programs Description

### 1. ATM
Simulates a basic ATM machine that performs transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, and balance inquiries. The program interacts with the user via a console interface.

### 2. Even
Checks if a given number is even or odd and prints the result accordingly.

### 3. GreenTicket
Solves a logic problem involving a lottery ticket where three integers determine the prize based on matching values.

### 4. In1020
Determines whether a given number is within the range of 10 to 20, inclusive.

### 5. LastDigit
Compares the last digits of two numbers to determine if they are the same.

### 6. LuckySum
Calculates the sum of three integers, but ignores any integer that is equal to 13, as it is considered unlucky.

### 7. Makes10
Checks if the sum of two numbers is 10, or if one of the numbers is 10.

### 8. Password
Generates or validates a password based on specific security rules like length, character types, etc.

### 9. StringTimes
Takes a string and an integer, and returns a new string where the original string is repeated the given number of times.

### 10. SumPrime
Calculates the sum of all prime numbers up to a given number.

### 11. SumDouble
Takes two integers and returns their sum, but if the numbers are the same, it returns double their sum.

### 12. TeenSum
Calculates the sum of two integers, but treats any integer between 13 and 19 as 0.

### 13. ZeroConverter
Replaces all occurrences of a specified number in an array with zero.

### 14. ReverseOfx
Reverses the digits of an integer and returns the reversed number.

### 15. Series
Generates a mathematical series based on user input and prints the result.

### 16. Sum
Calculates the sum of a series of numbers entered by the user.

### 17. DecToBin
Converts a decimal number to its binary equivalent.

### 18. FibPrime
Generates a series of prime numbers that are also part of the Fibonacci sequence.

### 19. NearestArmstrong
Finds the nearest Armstrong number (a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits) to a given input.

### 20. NearestPrime
Finds the nearest prime number to a given input.

### 21. PrimeDigitSum
Calculates the sum of the prime digits in a given number.

### 22. PrimeFib
Checks if a given Fibonacci number is prime.
